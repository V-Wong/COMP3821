# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Overview of DP
- Build an optimal solution to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems.
- Subproblems chosen in a way that allows for recursive construction of optimal solutions to problems from optimal solutions to smaller size problems.
- Efficient because the sets of subproblems needed to solve larger problems heavily overlap. 
- Each subproblem is solved only once and its solution is stored in a table for multiple use for solving many larger problems.
