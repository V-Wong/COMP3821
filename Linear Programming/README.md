# Linear Programming

## Overview of LP
- Method to achieve best outcome (maximum profit or lowest cost) in 
mathematical model represented by linear relationships.

## Canonical Form
- **x**: vector of variables to be determined.
- **c** and **b**: vector of known coefficients.
- A: matrix of known coefficients.
>Maximize **c**<sup>T</sup>**x** subject to A**x** ≤ **b** and **x** ≥ **0**.

- **c**<sup>T</sup>**x** is a scalar sum and is known as the objective function.
- We say two vectors are comparable if they are of the same dimension.
- We say a vector **x** is greater than a vector **y** if each corresponding entry in **x** is greater than the corrresponding entry in **y**.
